                <em>This</em> is a <b>paragraph</b>.
                Well, In this part, I was meant to use lorem to add words to my page but i decided on typing something by myself so I could learn better.
            </p>

            <a href="http://example.com" target="_blank">Visit website</a>
            <h1> Heading 1</h1>
            <p>This is a typical example of a heading with a paragraph in it. I have learnt it and you can too. You just have to focus and take this thing seriously, as they say, Opportunity comes but once.</p>
            <h2> Heading 2</h2>
            <p> This is another example of what a website with a subtitle/title can look like.</p>
            <h3> Heading 3</h3>
            <h4> Heading 4</h4>
            <h5> Heading 5</h5>
            <h6> Heading 6</h6>

            <h1>My life story</h1>
            <p>My story is very unique. It is the tale of a young girl who fought through the odds and challenges of life and came out victorious in the end. The most important lesson is that we should never give up. The name of the young girl was Adannaya. She was very hardworking and she was very kind. She had a heart of gold and she thought like a machine, but life was very unfair to her, especially when her stepmother almost killed her.</p> <P>Her stepmother was in fact, the devil in woman form. She tortued Adannaya day and night and even went to the extent of stabbingg her with a knife. I am Adannaya, the girl that died and came back to life, the girl that saw Death, Suffering and Sorrow face-to-face.I am the girl that has seen all evils of life. I am the girl that loves Puff puff so much.I am ADANNAYA.</P>
